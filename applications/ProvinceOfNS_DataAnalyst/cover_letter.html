        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the <span class="highlight">Data Analyst position</span> with the Province of Nova Scotia. As a Computer Engineering graduate with expertise in data analysis and program evaluation, I am eager to contribute to evidence-based decision making and support initiatives that benefit Nova Scotians.</p>

        <p>My experience at Moah Appliances, where I was recognized as <strong>Employee of the Quarter</strong>, demonstrates my ability to deliver data-driven insights that improve organizational outcomes. I developed expertise in <span class="highlight">program evaluation methodologies, data collection, and outcomes research</span>—directly aligning with this role's requirements.</p>

        <p>What draws me to the public sector is the opportunity to apply my analytical skills to initiatives that have meaningful impact on communities. I am particularly skilled in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Designing instruments and protocols for accurate data gathering</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Using Python and SQL to analyze datasets and identify trends</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Creating clear, actionable reports for stakeholders using Power BI</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Ensuring data integrity through validation protocols</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Being a finalist at the Gujarat Industrial Hackathon demonstrated my commitment to innovative problem-solving—a value I would bring to supporting Nova Scotia's programs and services.</p>

        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills in data analysis and program evaluation can contribute to the important work of the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
