        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the <span class="highlight">Analyst position in the Valuation and Advisory division</span> at Altus Group. As a recent Computer Engineering graduate with a specialization in AI and Data Science, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my analytical skills and technical expertise to support Altus Group's market-leading real estate valuation services in Atlantic Canada.</p>

        <p>During my time at Moah Appliances, I was recognized as <strong>Employee of the Quarter</strong> for developing automated data analysis solutions that improved operational efficiency. This experience taught me the importance of <span class="highlight">precision, attention to detail, and delivering accurate insights</span>—qualities essential for valuation and advisory work. I developed expertise in statistical analysis, data validation, and creating comprehensive reports using Power BI and Python.</p>

        <p>What draws me to Altus Group specifically is your reputation for excellence in property valuation and your commitment to providing clients with data-driven insights for informed decision-making. I am particularly interested in the opportunity to work with ARGUS software and contribute to market research that impacts real estate development and investment across Canada. My background includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Advanced proficiency in Python, SQL, and Power BI for data processing and visualization</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Experience with data validation protocols ensuring accuracy and reliability</li>
            <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> Capstone project involving comprehensive market data analysis and reporting</li>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Built RPA workflows and automated reporting systems, reducing manual processing time by 40%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Being a finalist at the Gujarat Industrial Hackathon demonstrated my ability to approach complex problems with creativity and persistence—traits that align with Altus Group's innovative culture. I am eager to learn from your experienced team while contributing fresh perspectives and technical capabilities to your valuation projects.</p>

        <p>I am excited about the opportunity to grow my career in real estate valuation and advisory services with a market leader like Altus Group. Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in data analysis and engineering can contribute to your team's continued success.</p>

        <p>I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you soon.</p>
