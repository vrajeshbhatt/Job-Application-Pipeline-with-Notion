## Option 1: Technical Deep Dive

🚀 Just built an **AI-powered Job Application Pipeline** that automates my Data Analyst job search!

### What it does:
🔍 Auto-searches 50+ job postings daily  
📄 Generates tailored resumes & cover letters  
📊 Scores matches (only applies to 80%+ fits)  
📓 Tracks everything in Notion  
🔔 Alerts me via Telegram for urgent opportunities

### Tech Stack:
• Python + OpenClaw for orchestration  
• Brave Search API for job discovery  
• Kimi K2.5 (via OpenRouter) for resume tailoring  
• ElevenLabs for voice briefings  
• Notion API for tracking

### Key Features:
✅ Filters for Atlantic Canada roles (my target)  
✅ Prioritizes entry-level Data Analyst positions  
✅ Human-in-the-loop: I approve before any submission  
✅ All credentials securely stored (never in code)

### Results so far:
• 50+ jobs discovered  
• 2 tailored application packages created  
• ~3 hours/day saved vs manual search

The full architecture & documentation is on my GitHub (sensitive info redacted, of course 😉).

**Looking for feedback:** Would you use something like this? What features would you add?

## Option 2: Storytelling Approach

Job searching used to take me 3+ hours every day.

❌ Scrolling LinkedIn  
❌ Copy-pasting job descriptions  
❌ Rewriting resumes for each application  
❌ Losing track of where I applied

So I built a solution: **MAYAI Job Application Pipeline**

🤖 It searches while I sleep  
🤖 It tailors my resume to each job  
🤖 It scores opportunities (only shows me 80%+ matches)  
🤖 It tracks everything automatically

Now I spend my time on what matters: preparing for interviews and connecting with people.

The best part? It's not a black box. I review every application before it goes out. AI does the heavy lifting; I make the decisions.

Built with Python, Brave Search API, OpenRouter, and Notion. Full write-up coming soon!

Have you experimented with AI in your job search? I'd love to hear your approach!

## Option 3: Short & Punchy

Built an AI agent that applies to jobs for me.

Well, almost. It:
• Finds 50+ opportunities/day
• Writes tailored resumes
• Scores match quality
• Tracks everything

I just hit "approve."

Game changer for my Data Analyst job search 🎯

## Comments/Thread Follow-ups

**If someone asks "Is this public?"**
The architecture and approach are documented on my GitHub! The code itself has some hardcoded personal info (my resume, target locations), so I'm cleaning that up before open-sourcing. Happy to share the framework though!

**If someone asks "Did you get interviews?"**
Just started deploying this actively! I've been refining it for the past week. Will share results in a follow-up post. Fingers crossed 🤞

**If someone asks "Can I use this?"**
DM me! I can share the framework. It's built on OpenClaw (autonomous agent platform), so you'd need some Python knowledge to customize it for your profile.

**If someone asks about API costs**
Great question! Most APIs have generous free tiers:
• Brave Search: 2000 queries/month free
• OpenRouter: Free tier available (I use stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free)
• ElevenLabs: 10k characters/month free
• Notion: Free for personal use

So far I'm at $0 cost!
