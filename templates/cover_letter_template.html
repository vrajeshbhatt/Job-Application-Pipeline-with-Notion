As a Computer Engineering graduate with a focus on AI and Data Science, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my technical skills and analytical mindset to your team.</p>

        <p>During my time at Moah Appliances, I was recognized as <strong>Employee of the Quarter</strong> for my work in analyzing operational data and developing automated reporting solutions using Python and Power BI.

            <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python, SQL, RPA automation</li>
            <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Power BI, Tableau, Excel</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Statistical analysis, data modeling, trend identification</li>
            <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> n8n automation, GitHub, collaborative tools</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What draws me to [Company Name] specifically is [mention something about the company - their mission, a project, or their industry focus]. As someone passionate about the aerospace and space technology sector, I am particularly excited about [specific company detail related to this interest if applicable].</p>

        <p>Being a finalist at the Gujarat Industrial Hackathon taught me to approach complex problems with creativity and persistence—qualities I would bring to every project at [Company Name]. I am eager to learn from your experienced team while contributing fresh perspectives and technical capabilities.</p>

        <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in computer engineering, data science, and proven track record of recognition can contribute to [Company Name]'s success. Thank you for considering my application.</p>
